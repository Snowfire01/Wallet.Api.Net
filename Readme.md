# Wallet.Api.Net

C# Wrapper for the [BudgetBakers Wallet API](https://budgetbakersv30apiv1.docs.apiary.io/#).

#### From Google Play

Wallet is your finance planner that helps you flexibly plan your budget and track spending, so you stay in control and achieve your goals. Actively plan, manage and get a report concerning your finances, together with the people you trust, across multiple currencies, banks and financial institutions. Upload your Loyalty or Reward cards too. Get and keep full control of your finances. Tracking your money just got easier. 

## Getting Started

At the moment there is no NuGet package available for the API, so you have to download the source code and use this for your project.

I have plans to implement a NuGet package, but don't know when that will be possible.

To use the API, you need an account in the [BudgetBakers Wallet App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droid4you.application.wallet). There you can access your personal API token under 
```
Settings -> Advanced Settings -> REST API
```.

With your E-Mail address and API token as authentication, you can access all functions of the API and manage your account via REST.
